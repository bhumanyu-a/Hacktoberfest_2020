# Caesar Cipher
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet
## Example
using a left shift of 3 
* **Plaintext :** ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
* **Cipher :** XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW

### Implementation (using a right shift of 7)
* Encryption
   * **Plaintext :** bhumanyu
   * **Cipher :** iobthufb
* Decryption
   * **Cipher :** iobthufb
   * **Plaintext :** bhumanyu
## Program
* for encryption, asks user for plaintext and key outputs the cipher.
* for decryption, asks for key and cipher and outputs cipher
